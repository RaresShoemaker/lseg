[!NOTE]
Setup of the project

## BACKEND
Use the next commands, in order in the terminal:

cd backend --> go into backend directory
npm install --> install dependecies & npm packages
npm run dev --> this will run the server on http://localhost:3000 

## FRONTEND

cd frontend --> go into backend directory
npm install --> install dependecies & npm packages
npm run dev --> this will run the client on http://localhost:5173

[!NOTE]
General Info

SERVER: uses a simple MVC architecture using express + typescript
CLEINT: uses VITE + typescript + SCSS && React components follow a pattern of hooks to separate the business logic from the UI part

P.S. The style of the client is super bad, also there is nothing optimized on React side, also regarding I don't think that I managed
to take into consideration all errors that can happen.
